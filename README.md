## 📚 Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/creators.png" />
</p>

**GiveBackGPT** is an initiative dedicated to creating a **fair and sustainable AI** ecosystem. This novel process orchestrates the automatic identification and crediting of **open-access content creators**, whose work is essential in training generative AI models and keeping them relatable.

By leveraging standard web search to find and credit content similar to AI-generated responses, GiveBackGPT aims to recognize and reward creators in a simple, platform-agnostic, and streamlined way. Placing creator crediting at the inference level aligns with the value extraction point, removing barriers for small AI teams to innovate and discouraging monopoly data licensing deals.

Our vision includes establishing a licensing framework where **GenAI vendors** pay for legal data access, supporting a more equitable AI economy. Additionally, an open fund governed democratically will provide monetary rewards to creators who register and grant AI usage rights.

Follow us for updates on our progress towards a comprehensive standalone solution and join us in supporting a **democratized AI future**.
