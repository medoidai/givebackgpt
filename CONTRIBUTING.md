# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to work with you to improve this project! To ensure a smooth collaboration process, we follow the GitHub Flow strategy. Here's how you can contribute:

## Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the repository**: Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the page. This action creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the forked repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine. This allows you to work on your changes locally before pushing them to GitHub.

## Create a Feature Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch from the `main` branch of your forked repository. This branch will contain your feature or bug fix. Ensure your modifications adhere to the project's coding conventions and standards.

## Sync Your Fork

To minimize the probability of merge conflicts, it's recommended to sync your forked repository frequently with the original repository's `main` branch. You can do this by using the "Sync fork" button available on the GitHub page of your forked repository.

## Open a Pull Request

Once your changes are complete and tested locally, open a pull request (PR) from your feature branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.

## Additional Notes

- **Documentation**: Make sure to update any relevant documentation along with your changes.

- **Testing**: If applicable, include tests to ensure your changes work as expected and do not break existing functionality.

- **Review and Merge**: After submitting your PR, project maintainers will review your code. Be responsive to feedback and make necessary adjustments. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the `main` branch of the original repository.
