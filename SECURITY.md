# Security Policy

To maintain the security of our project, we encourage all users and contributors to promptly report any potential vulnerabilities. Hereâ€™s how you can assist us:

- **Report privately**: Please send an email to [givebackgpt@medoid.ai](mailto:givebackgpt@medoid.ai) and clearly indicate that your message concerns security. For instance, use a subject line like "Security Issue - Project Name".

- **Include details**: Provide a thorough description of the vulnerability. If possible, attach supporting evidence such as code snippets or logs to your email.

- **Responsible disclosure**: Kindly allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and mitigate the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly. This approach ensures that we can resolve the issue before it poses a greater risk.

Thank you for helping us uphold the security of our project!
